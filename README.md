# WOL Verse Plugin for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Notetaking App

Looks for valid NWT bible verse references in the markdown text and and automatically converts them to valid [WOL Bible](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/binav/r1/lp-e/nwtsty) hyperlinks.  Visible in the HTML View mode only.

# How to Use

Download the **wol-verse-link** folder above and drop it into your **{Obsidian Vault}/.obsidian/plugins** folder, then restart Obsidian.

To see it in action open a page which contains bible verse references, e.g. Rom 1:20; Psalm 89:18; 1 Cor 9:26, etc... and switch to HTML view.  
You should see that all verse references have been converted into hyperlinks.  *Note: This only affects the HTML view not the underlying markdown text!*
