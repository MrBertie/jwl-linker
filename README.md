# JW Library Verse Plugin for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Notetaking App

Looks for valid NWT Bible verse references in the Markdown text and and automatically displays them as working local JW Library hyperlinks in the Reading View.

# How to Use

Download the **jwlib-verse-link** folder above and drop it into your **{Obsidian Vault}/.obsidian/plugins** folder, then restart Obsidian.  You will need to go to the plugin settings page in Obsidian and enable the plugin.

To see it in action: open a page which contains bible verse references, e.g. Rom 1:20; Psalm 89:18; 1 Cor 9:26, etc... and switch to Reading view.  
You should see that all verse references are now displayed as hyperlinks, and any abbreviated book names will be written out in full.  

Click on the link to open your installed JW Library app directly at that verse.

*Note: This only affects the Reading view not the underlying markdown text!*
