# JW Library Verse Link Plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

This plugin looks for valid NWT Bible verse references in the Markdown text and and then automatically displays them in the Reading View as hyperlinks to your local JW Library.

# How to Use

Download the **jwlib-verse-link** folder above and drop it into your **{Obsidian Vault}/.obsidian/plugins** folder, then restart Obsidian.  You will need to go to the Plugin Settings page in Obsidian and enable the plugin.

To see it in action: open a page which contains bible verse references, e.g. Rom 1:20; Psalm 89:18; 1 Cor 9:26, etc... and then switch to Reading view.  
You should see that all verse references are now displayed as hyperlinks, in addition any abbreviated book names will be written out in full.  

Click on the link to open your installed JW Library app directly at that verse.

# Notes
This only affects the Reading view not the underlying Markdown text!*
