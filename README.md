# WOL Verse Plugin for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) Notetaking App

Looks for valid NWT Bible verse references in the Markdown text and and automatically converts them to valid [WOL Bible](https://wol.jw.org/en/wol/binav/r1/lp-e/nwtsty) hyperlinks in the HTML View.


# How to Use

Download the **wol-verse-link** folder above and drop it into your **{Obsidian Vault}/.obsidian/plugins** folder, then restart Obsidian.


To see it in action open a page which contains bible verse references, e.g. Rom 1:20; Psalm 89:18; 1 Cor 9:26, etc... and switch to HTML view.  
You should see that all verse references have been converted into hyperlinks, and any abbreviated book names will be written out in full.  
*Note: This only affects the HTML view not the underlying markdown text!*
